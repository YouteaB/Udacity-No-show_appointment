# Udacity-No-show_appointment
Udacity's Project 1 on Investigate a Dataset
## Project: No-show appointment Data Analysis
### Introduction
In this "Investigate a Dataset" project, I will be analyzing the No-show appointment dataset to determine the relationship between the features and the extent to which the independent variables influence the target variable or the dependent variable. The percentage of people who showed up for their appointments would be calculated and analysis would be carried out to determine if the factors like diseases, being on schorlarship or receiving SMS influenced these patients availability to meet up with their appointments.

Dataset description: The No-show appointment dataset which is original sourced on Kaggle contains information from over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. The dataset consists of 110527 rows and 14 columns.

Columns:

1. PatientId
2. AppointmentID
3. Gender
4. ScheduledDay
5. AppointmentDay
6. Age
7. Neighbourhood
8. Scholarship
9. Hypertension (originally Hipertension)
10. Diabetes
11. Alcoholism
12. Handicap (originally Handcap)
